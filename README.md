# RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar  <img src ="RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar/Images/jaguar.jpg" width=99>
This is a RESTful API testing Framework using .NET Core, xUnit, Specflow BDD with context injection, Flurl and Fluent Assertions to test JSONPlaceholder REST API.  

## Specflow  <img src ="RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar/Images/specflow.png" width=99>
Use SpecFlow to define, manage and automatically execute human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects. Writing easily understandable tests is a cornerstone of the BDD paradigm and also helps build up a living documentation of your system. https://specflow.org/
### Context Injection
SpecFlow supports a very simple dependency framework that is able to instantiate and inject class instances for the scenarios. With this feature you can group the shared state to context-classes, and inject them into every binding class that is interested in that shared state. https://specflow.org/documentation/Context-Injection/

## Target framework  <img src ="RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar/Images/netcore.png" width=50>
.NET Core 2.1

## JSONPlaceholder  <img src ="RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar/Images/JSONPlaceholder.jpg" width=99>
JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data. It's great for tutorials, testing new libraries, sharing code examples.

## Routes Tested
The following HTTP methods are tested:
* GET
* POST
* PUT
* PATCH
* DELETE

## Flurl  <img src ="RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar/Images/flurl.png" width=75>
Flurl is a modern, fluent, asynchronous, testable, portable, buzzword-laden URL builder and HTTP client library for .NET. https://flurl.dev/
### Fluent HTTP
Flurl allows you to perform many common HTTP tasks directly off the fluent URL builder chain. Barely under the hood is HttpClient and related classes. As you'll see, Flurl enhances HttpClient with convenience methods and fluent goodness but doesn't try to abstract it away completely.

## Assertions <img src ="RestApiTesting.Framework.Jaguar/Images/fluentassertions.png" width=99>
Fluent Assertions is used for validation.

## Integrated Development Environment
Microsoft Visual Studio IDE is used to develop this Framework.
### Visual Studio Extensions
